# Inferential-Statistics-Graded-Project
Course: Inferential Statistics
The Inferential Statistics Project addresses three problems in various industries. It involves data analysis and hypothesis testing to provide insights on stone suitability for printing, the effectiveness of a fitness program, and the impact of dentists and implant methods on metal implant hardness. These findings will support data-driven decision-making and operational improvements for the respective companies.

Skills & Tools Covered:
Probabilty
Probabilty Distribution
Hypothesis Testing
ANOVA
My Learnings:
🎲 1. Understanding Probability and Distributions: Strengthened your grasp of probability concepts and their application in real-world business problems. Learned to identify and apply appropriate probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial) to model uncertainty and variation in datasets. 🔍 2. Hypothesis Testing: Gained hands-on experience in formulating and testing null and alternative hypotheses to draw conclusions about population parameters. Applied Z-test, t-test, and chi-square tests to evaluate real-world questions, such as: Whether a specific type of stone is suitable for printing. If a fitness program is statistically effective. 📊 3. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Used ANOVA to compare means across multiple groups, such as: Evaluating the influence of different dentists or implant methods on the hardness of metal implants. Learned to interpret F-statistic and p-values to determine significant differences between group performances. 📈 4. Drawing Business Insights from Statistical Results: Translated statistical outcomes into actionable business decisions, such as: Recommending the best type of stone for print production. Justifying the effectiveness of a health/fitness intervention. Identifying optimal combinations of dentist and implant method for superior outcomes. 🛠️ 5. Tools & Critical Thinking: Improved your ability to: Choose the right test for each problem. Interpret confidence intervals, p-values, and statistical significance. Maintain rigor in statistical analysis to avoid misleading conclusions. 💡 Overall Takeaway: Learned to apply core inferential statistics techniques—like hypothesis testing and ANOVA—to evaluate real-world scenarios across industries. This project enhanced my ability to make data-driven decisions with statistical confidence, a crucial skill in research, quality control, and operational improvement.
